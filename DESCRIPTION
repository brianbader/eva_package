Title: Extreme Value Analysis with Goodness-of-Fit Testing
Date: 2015-12-28
Version: 0.1.1
Authors@R: c(person(given = "Brian", family = "Bader", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "brianbader@mail.com"), person(given = "Jun", family = "Yan", role = "aut"))
Description: Goodness-of-fit tests for selection of r in the r-largest order
    statistics (GEVr) model. Goodness-of-fit tests for threshold selection in the
    peaks-over-threshold approach. Random number generation and density functions
    for the GEVr distribution. Profile likelihood for return level estimation
    using the GEVr and generalized pareto distributions. P-value adjustments for
    sequential, multiple testing error control.
